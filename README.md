## Name of Game
> __Maze Runner__

## Game Description
> Basically, it is a game in which a player escapes from the maze. Player has some characteristic such as life, visual range, and moving range. These characteristics can be obtained or got increased by sub-games in maze. When a player reaches a specific section of the maze, these sub-game events occur. The kinds of sub-games are three, and those are rock-scissor-paper game, up-down game, and quiz game about programming or Handong University.
>	> These can be modified if needed during proceeding project.

## Role of Each Student

### Jung Hansoo
1. Implementing Maze class.
2. Managing codes of project.
> 'Managing codes' means reviewing realized classes and to link them organically. Also, including implementing the main class and player class.

### Im Chanhyeok
1. Implementing Maze class.
2. Managing codes of projects.

### Lee Wonbin
1. Implementing quiz game class.
2. Managing codes of projects.

### Gwon Juyoung
1. Implementing up-down game class
2. ppt production (for presentation)

### Kim Yeongmin
1. Implementing rock-scissor-paper game class
2. Present the project.

## Plan
1.	Implement classes for maze, rock-scissor-paper game, up-down game, and quiz game
2.	Review whether each class has been implemented as intended. In addition, if any deficiencies are found through these feedbacks, correct them.
3.	Implement main class controlling the overall flow of game, and player class.
4.	Also, review and correct those classes.
5.	Connecting classes that have been implemented so far, so that the classes work together as one program.
6.	Testing the program, gathering feedbacks, and going through the modification.
7.	Testing the program finally and complete the project.
